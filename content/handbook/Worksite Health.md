# Worksite Health

> ## Vaccination Policy

## Associate Health and Well-Being 

${env.company} supports our associates in making informed decisions about their health.   Just as we work to empower participants on their well-being, we expect our associates to take command of their own health and those dependent on them.

## Informed by our Core value of Respect

${env.company}'s core values include respect, synchronicity and trust; these three values lead to health in the present moment and resilience for all time.

> Respect includes the tradition of helping, security in physical, emotional, social and privacy safety, and respect for all relationships (with self, people, places and things)

Therefore, we start with respect for individual associates.   Privacy is paramount and we respect individual health choices that promote individual and collective well-being.

We layer on respect for those with whom our associates interact.  This might mean following local health protocols, such as social distancing, where one associate's behaviors could impact others, when the preponderance of evidence supports such protocols or local regulations or building code requires it.

We layer on respect for our customers and the populations that they in turn serve (e.g., employees, patients, faculty, students and/or consumers).   This means that when we visit our customers, we generally follow their worksite health requirements, such as wearing a hard hat on a construction site, or wearing face masks if they require it.   At the same time, we won't ask our associates to compromise their own medical or religious beliefs in serving our customers needs;  if there is unresolvable conflict between individual and customer beliefs, then we might look to other assignments or see if remote only work is possible.   We'll do our best to find a solution that works for all, where one exists.


## Vaccination mandates

Post the onset of COVID-19, some of our customers introduced temporary or indefinite vaccination mandates.    Our current approach is to assure our customers than any of our associates, vendors, or partners that serve such a customer in a physical onsite setting (or are likely to do so in the near future) will be vaccinated, have natural immunity, or have an approved exemption on medical or spiritual beliefs.  

> Some customers may ask for proof of vaccination, immunity, or an exemption on medical or religious grounds

We do not currently track or require proof of vaccination or exemptions in any other situation other than for those customers that demand it

The data and science surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 virus are fluid and best practices continue to be updated.    We follow this as best we can, and so we expect that this policy and approach will continue to evolve. 

For clarity, we do expect associates to use the best available information and resources to promote their own well-being, and generally encourage and remove all barriers that we can for access to commonly recommended immunizations (e.g., flu shots and other corona viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and its variants) in order to minimize health impairment and thus better serve more lives all the time.

<form action="https://forms.office.com/r/h1CvT9q8k0">
    <input type="submit" value="Upload Proof of Vaccination or Request Exemption" />
</form>

If you are assigned to a customer account that requires documentation of immunization, and are likely to serve or visit them in a physical capacity (as opposed to telehealth where no face to face interaction is expected), then you will need to provide this information to our Human Talent team, via the secure upload facility provided.

You can do so by uploading a record of your immunization history (e.g., United States CDC Vaccination Card) and/or a signed note from your physician providing reasons for a medical exemption, and/or a signed note from you indicating a sincerely held religious exemption.  

We generally do not provide individual status to our customers but rather report compliance with their needs in the aggregate;  you are free to provide any information asked on an individual basis (e.g., to gain entry to a facility) but we do not require you to do so and will provide a generic letter and QR code upon request that you have met our compliance needs

Exemptions are expected to be rare, but to make this easy we provide a link in the submission form to some pre-completed verbiage that has been acceptable in the past. 

If you have evidence of natural immunity, for example as evidenced by positive serology/antibody tests and other adaptive immune response tests that is supported by the scientific literature (e.g., [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100354](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100354)), then you may provide the test results from an accredited testing center that includes:
- Type of test (indicating it is antibody test and not a test for active infection)
- Entity issuing the result (e.g. laboratory, healthcare entity, or telehealth service), and name of the overseeing physician
- Specimen collection date
- Information that identifies you personally (full name plus at least one other identifier such as date of birth or passport number)
- Test Result

> Privacy by design -- we follow the rule of least privilege and only share information with those who have a need to know.  


## SyncSpace

For offices that are majority owned or leased by ${env.company} and shared with partners, investors or customers, we follow our own policy and local guidelines, which at times may be more risk averse or less risk averse than that of our business partners.   We do this to best respond to and respect local needs and business agility.


## Looking ahead

> Things can change rapidly

This is an evolving guideline that was first added in 2021 in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and changing requirements of our customers.  Please stay up to date for changes or clarifications to this policy.
