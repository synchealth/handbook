# Only "employed" pets allowed

> In general - ${env.company} human associates are not permitted to bring their pets to work.

- We do have a few Canine associates - that are either here to serve everyone or the particular human that they have been trained to serve.  

- Please ask before interacting with the employed companions because you may not be able to tell if they are actively working on a task. 



### Allergies or other preferences

If there is a Canine associate having a negative impact on your ${env.company} experience, please let your manager know and we will work to find a solution!
