# Conflicts of Interest

> You shouldn't be doing things outside of work that we pay you to do for customers and participants.

Conflicts of interest arise when you become involved in any business or other activity that may conflict with the best interests of our customers, or in any way, interfere with your ability to completely carry out your responsibilities.

Our policy is to conduct business ethically and to avoid conflicts of interest or even the appearance of such conflicts.

- We all have an equal duty to avoid conflicts of interest. You must fully disclose and refrain from engaging in any activities that create a conflict of interest between your personal interests and the interests of the company. You are expected to report conflicts of interest to the HR/Compliance team immediately upon discovery or suspicion of a conflict.

Conflicts include, but are not limited to, the following situations:

* **Direct Conflict of Interest** - Ownership by you or a family member of a substantial financial interest in any outside concern that does business with, or is a competitor to ${env.company} (except where such interest consists of an insubstantial percentage of a publicly-owned corporation). *If you are doing something on the side that we do, you are in conflict.*


* **Inducments** Acceptance by you or a family member of gifts (of more than token value), loans, (other than from established financial institutions), excessive entertainment, or other substantial favors from any outside concern that does business with, or is seeking to do business with, or is a competitor of ${env.company}
