# Time Off of all kinds

We take time off seriously at ${env.company}.  

- Philosophy: Your time off is a priority because it makes your time on productive!

Types of time off covered in this section:

- Holiday
- Vacation
-  Maternity
- Family Emergency
- Sick Leave Well BE-ing leave
- Extended Leave
- Leave w/o pay
- Sabbatical

### Critical Personnel
-  if you are in one of these roles, you already know it.  Your holidays and time off will be handled differently. Your supervisor or manager will share the details. 


### Holidays and Vacation Time 

#### work-time versus off-work time:
Because we are a global organization we aim to honor everyone's priorities & traditions and encourage you to nurture your passions & feed your soul. 

### So in order to keep it simple: All Associates below the manager level starts with the same amount of "leave time" = about 6 weeks.

### The break down is as follows: 
- 23 PTO days ** 
- 5 pre-set holidays  
- 4 floater holidays 

** As of January 1, 2024, California associates receive 18 days of PTO and 5 sick days. PTO in states with mandatory sick leave may be a combination of PTO/Sick Leave equal to 23 days. 

** PTO is accrued every pay period and part-time associates will accrue PTO on a pro-rated basis

#### That's 32 days (weekdays) to take care of yourself, your family, honoring culture or tradition or just loving life! 

### PTO Procedures

In addition to vacation, PTO is designed to cover leave for personal sickness, family sickness, bereavement, family activities and extra holiday time. Associates may find they need time away from work prior to accruing the hours necessary. In such cases, an Associate may build up a negative balance with the prior approval of his or her supervisor.

In general, all PTO must be submitted in Paychex and preapproved by and prescheduled with the Associate’s supervisor and may be taken in 4 hour increments. Approval for all scheduled time away is subject to applicable workloads. In case of an emergency, however, Associates shall be allowed to take up to 24 hours of unscheduled PTO with less than 24 hours’ notice and regardless of applicable workload.

Associates accrue PTO based on hours worked per pay period.   Associates can accrue a maximum of 184 hours of PTO. Associates with 184 hours of PTO will not accrue PTO until their PTO balance falls below 184 hours.

PTO will not be paid out at separation unless required by state law. 


### Honoring Global Tradition

We aim to embrace all cultures and religions - and understand individual hallmarks are important to fostering a healthy, inclusive, and empathic work environment. 

> We cannot celebrate everyone's personally cherished holidays in an effort to be universally tolerant though, as this would be constant celebration, and we wouldn't get much work done. 

Therefore celebration for specific holidays are welcome and we encourage you to share about your traditions in the Synchronous community.  These celebrations should occur outside of the typical workday of your team.   

#### ${env.company} also chooses to honor some of the standard US Federal Holidays.  Here are the other Federal Holidays we recognize as off-work days

* New Year's Day

* Memorial Day 

* Independence Day (July 4th)

* Labor Day 

* Thanksgiving

* 4 Floater Holidays to celebrate the tradtion of your choosing or any day you see fit (prorated for PT associates)

### Floater Holiday Allotment 

Floating holidays are available upon hire and reset on your work anniversary. These floating holidays may be used only for religious or cultural holidays, employee birthdays, or other state or federal holidays during which Synchronous Health remains open. 

Floating holidays reset and cannot be cashed out if not taken or paid upon termination of employment. 

### There is another special day that we consider worthy of dedicated celebration in honor of what we are all doing here:

> #### Karla's BotDay - Karla's official creation day is 6/6/16 and we celebrate this as any famous Icon's birthday is honored!  We hope you will join us for the Company celebration each year on or around this day!

* This is a day designed to honor our mission - promoting Kindness. A portion of this day will shift your attention from working directly with customers or participants and allow us all to be "together" in a planned company celebration.  

* This doesn't have to be the only day to act on Karla's behalf, our managers are encouraged to create time for their team to do Random Acts of Kindness, such as a collaborative project in service to the community. So, if you have an idea, bring it to your manager's attention and SPREAD THE KINDNESS WITH YOUR TEAM!

## Parental Leaves (school events, maternity, paternity & adoption) 

Children are important and we know raising them is hard and we don't want to miss those special moments like school recitals, IEPs and parent-teacher conferences.  Please submit any requests for time off related to school events at least one week in advance with your manager. 

We absolutely support you and taking time off to embrace and adjust a major family change.
