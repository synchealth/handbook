# BYOD

> Bring Your Own Device.

### Personal Preference

${env.company} wants our associates to be using the technical hardware that is comfortable for each person and thus does not require nor provide any particular devices.  Your role may require certain features such as laptop versus tablet and that will be covered by your hiring manager.  

### Requirements

"Associate understands that they must have the necessary equipment and environment to conduct remote work for the company. They must have a computer or laptop with a webcam, high-speed Internet with a direct connection, an audio source and a headset to support the audio source, a battery backup device, and a secure place to work with four walls and a door to simulate an office space."

### Hardship

There are times in life where money is tight so if you do not have an adequate device or something unexpected happens to the one you have, please talk to your manager and we will do our best to help you resolve your technology needs.
