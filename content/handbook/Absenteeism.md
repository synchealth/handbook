# Absenteeism

> If you are not working when you are reasonably expected to be working, you are absent.

*In order to achieve our mission and have a positive impact on the world, we all need to participate consistently.  There is a reasonable expectation for our mutual success that you will be working when & where you say you will be.*

Many of the innovation and operations at ${env.company} are interdependent on co-workers. 

- PLEASE be respectful of our mission and your team - Be punctual and consistent with your schedule. 

${env.company} has [flexible hours](hours.md) for most positions with the exception of positions that are critical to client-facing localized hours (e.g. tech support, crisis response, front desk, etc.) for reasons of [customer-service](manual/customer-service.md). 

You are responsible for contacting your managers before the start of the committed hours if you are going to be absent or late. 

Absent and Late happens to all of us.  

Just be respectful and communicate as soon as possible and your manager can let the rest of us know that you are OK.
