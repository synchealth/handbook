# Housekeeping

> If you make a mess, please clean it up. 


## Please ensure you clean up after yourself in order to maintain the space for everyone to enjoy.  

> What you dirty, wash and dry. 

> What you spill, wipe up. 

> What you put in the fridge, eat or take home.

## We all deserve to feel that our work space is respected.

### Cleaning is a great way to practice you R.A.K.'s 
(random acts of kindness)
