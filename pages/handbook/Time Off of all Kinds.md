### Critical Personnel
 -  if you are in one of these roles, you already know it.  Your holidays and time off will be handled differently. Your supervisor or manager will share the details. 


### Holidays and Vacation Time 

#### work-time versus off-work time:
Because we are a global organization we aim to honor everyone's priorities & traditions and encourage you to nurture your passions & feed your soul. 

### So in order to keep it simple: Everybody starts with the same amount of "leave time" = about 6 weeks.

### The break down is as follows: 
- 23 PTO days which is vacay + sick leave 
- 7 pre-set holidays
- 4 floater holidays

#### That's 34 days (weekdays) to take care of yourself, your family, honoring culture or tradition or just loving life! 

### Honoring Global Tradition

We aim to embrace all cultures and religions - and understand individual hallmarks are important to fostering a healthy, inclusive, and empathic work environment. 

> We cannot celebrate everyone's personally cherished holidays in an effort to be universally tolerant though, as this would be constant celebration, and we wouldn't get much work done. 

Therefore celebration for specific holidays are welcome and we encourage you to share about your traditions in the Synchronous community.  These celebrations should occur outside of the typical workday of your team.   

#### Plus ${env.company} chooses to honor some of the standard US Federal Holidays an a few others that we consider worthy of off-work time.

*  #### Karla's BotDay - Karla's official creation day is 6/6/16 and we celebrate this as any famous Icon's birthday is honored!  We hope you will join us for the Company celebration each year on or around this day!

* #### R.A.K. day - Our mission is promoting Kindness.  So everyone is encouraged to take a day for Random Acts of Kindness, a day to be of service to your community.  Use this time to serve at Habitat for Humanity, the homeless Mission, or the local free clinic.
